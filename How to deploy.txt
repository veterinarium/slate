1. If use just downloaded the code, then you need to make one time setup

	* Should work for Linux and Mac, not sure if it will work for Windows 

	1. Install ruby 2.3.1 (exactly this version)
	2. Go to the cloned folder in command prompt
	3. Install bundler for slate ( https://github.com/lord/slate )  - may not work for windows



2. To edit documentation


	This repository ( https://github.com/veterinarium/slate.git ) only contains the documentation source code ( docs.sources ) .

	To edit documentation just edit *.md files in sources folder. 

	To see the changes run 'bundle exec middleman server' in Terminal. (and then open http://0.0.0.0:4567 in browser)

	To push the changes to the github just use: git push.

	To publish these changes to http://veterinarium.github.io/ do next:

		1) go to the docs.sources folder in the Terminal
		2) run 'bundle exec middleman build --clean' in the Terminal
			-> this will build html files and put them in /build folder
		
		3) Copy /build folder contents to the 'docs.veterinarium.io' project ( https://github.com/veterinarium/veterinarium.github.io.git )
		4) Push changes to github for 'docs.veterinarium.io'
			-> changes should immediatelly appear on http://veterinarium.github.io/
