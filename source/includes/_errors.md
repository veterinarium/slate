Smart Flow Sheet uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with SFS's servers.

Not all errors map cleanly onto HTTP response codes, however. Please refer to the documentation on a particular API method for the details on possible HTTP codes and responses.

## The Error object

```http
GET /inventoryitem HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
```
```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Accept: application/json

{
   "Message" : "Inventory item not found"
}
```

Smart Flow Sheet may send the Error object in the response to the API methods that failed with the [4xx HTTP status codes](#errors). 

Also, SFS expects EMR to send the Error object (optionally) in the response to the event calls that fail together with the 4xx HTTP status codes.
