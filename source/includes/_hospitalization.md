# Hospitalizations

Hospitalization is an abstraction used in Smart Flow Sheet to represent the patient record. As soon as patient is admitted in the hospital the Hospitalization object is created. In turn, the hospitalization object nests patient and client information. This information can be transferred and retrieved from SFS using the patient object and the client object.   

The are the `hospitalizations` and `hospitalization` objects used to create hosptitalizations in SFS and receiving events from the Smart Flow Sheet services.

## The hospitalizations object

### Attributes

Parameter | Type | Description
---------- | ------- | -------
**objectType** | String | *Optional*. Describes the type of the object transferred with the SFS events. Should be assigned `hospitalizations` value
**id** | String | *Optional*. Identificator of the object. Will be transferred to EMR with the SFS events 
**hospitalizations** | Array | The array of [`hospitalization`](#the-hospitalization-object) objects. 


This object will be sent with the `hospitalizations.discharged` event in case when multiple patients were [discharged](#discharge-hospitalization-event) from the Smart Flow Sheet whiteboard.

## The hospitalization object

### Attributes

Parameter | Type | Description
---------- | ------- | -------
**objectType** | String | *Optional*. Describes the type of the object transferred with the SFS events. Should be assigned `hospitalization` value

## Create a patient

```

* Url: /hospitalization
* Method: POST
* Synchronous
* Accepts [`hospitalization`](#the-hospitalization-object) object
* Returns HTTP status 201 in case the new hospitalization has been created
* In case of error returns the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object

<aside class="warning">
The Smart Slow Sheet API does not allow to create several hospitalizations with the same `hospitalizationId`. However, it may happen that the user needs to re-submit the hospitalization that has been previously created (and then deleted or discharged from Smart Flow Sheet user interface). In this case, the second call of this API will return the error with the message `Hospitalization already exists`.  If this happens, we advise to show the user the error message and prompt them if they would like to re-submit the patient. If user selects the option to re-submit the patient, then EMR should:

1. Make a call to [`delete hospitalization`](#delete-hospitalization) API first;
2. Call [create a patient](#create-a-patient) API again to re-submit the patient information.

## Get active hospitalizations

> Example Request:

```http
GET /hospitalizations HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
```

This method allows to get all hospitalizations that have `active` value of the `status` field.  

* Url: /hospitalizations
* Method: GET
* Synchronous
* Returns HTTP status 200 and a collection of [`hospitalization`](#the-hospitalization-object) objects
* In case of error returns the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object

## Get hospitalization

> Example Request:

```http
GET /hospitalization/emr-hospitalization-id HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
```

This method allows to get information about hospitalization by id. Specify the `hospitalizationId` of the hospitalization object in the EMR. The same `hospitalizationId` that was supplied when hospitalization had been created. 

* Url: /hospitalization/{hospitalizationId}
* Method: GET
* Synchronous
* Returns HTTP status 200 and the [`hospitalization`](#the-hospitalization-object) object
* If hospitalization cannot be found in SFS, the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object will be returned with HTTP 404 status code

## Delete hospitalization

> Example Request:

```http
DELETE /hospitalization/emr-hospitalization-id HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
```

This method deletes hospitalization by id. Specify the `hospitalizationId` of the hospitalization object in the EMR. The same `hospitalizationId` that was supplied when hospitalization had been created. 
This method also "unmaps" the `hospitalizationId` from the internal hospitalization record - this allows to submit the patient to Smart Flow Sheet again afterward.

* Url: /hospitalization/{hospitalizationId}
* Method: DELETE
* Synchronous
* If hospitalization cannot be found in SFS, the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object will be returned with HTTP 404 status code

## Discharge hospitalization event

> Example of `hospitalizations.discharged` event JSON:

```json
{
    "clinicApiKey": "clinic-api-key",
    "eventType": "hospitalizations.discharged",
    "object": {
	    "objectType": "hospitalizations",
		"id": "sfs-operation-id",
		"hospitalizations": [
			{
				"objectType": "hospitalization",
				"hospitalizationId": "emr-hospitalization-id",
				"hospitalizationGuid": "sfs-hospitalization-guid",
				"dateCreated": "2014-11-05T10:20:19.000+00:00",
				"fileNumber": "#File number",
				"reportPath": "https://pdf-report-webfile-path"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

As soon as one or several patients have been discharged from the Smart Flow Sheet whiteboard, SFS will notify EMR by sending one of the following events:

1. The `hospitalization.discharged` event in case if single patient was discharged. In this case the [hospitalization](#the-hospitalization-object) object will be transferred with the event.

2. The `hospitalizations.discharged` event in case if multiple patients were discharged. In this case the [hospitalizations](#the-hospitalizations-object) object will be transferred with the event.

Every `hospitalization` object transferred with these events will contain the path to the flowsheet report pdf file in the `reportPath` field. If for some reason the value of this field is empty then you may explicitly [download the flowsheet report](#download-the-flowsheet-report).

<aside class="notice">
There is no API that allow to discharge a patient. Any patient can be discharged only using Smart Flow Sheet user interface.

## Download the Flowsheet report

> Example Request:

```http
GET /hospitalization/emr-hospitalization-id/flowsheetreport HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0

emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
timezoneName: Europe/Helsinki
```

This method allows to download the flowsheet report from Smart Flow Sheet.

All the dates in the downloaded report will be represented in the time zone that you **must** explicitly specify in the `timezoneName` header of the HTTP request (e.g. `timezoneName: Europe/Helsinki`). Please visit this [web-page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for the complete list of the time zone names. 

Specify the `hospitalizationId` of the hospitalization object in the EMR. The same `hospitalizationId` that was supplied when hospitalization had been created.

* Url: /hospitalization/{hospitalizationId}/flowsheetreport
* Method: GET
* Synchronous
* Returns the pdf report with the output stream. The Content-Type header will contain the `application/pdf` value
* In case of error returns the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object

All the dates in the downloaded report will be represented in the time zone that you **must** explicitly specify in the `timezoneName` header of the HTTP request (e.g. `timezoneName: Europe/Helsinki`). Please visit this [web-page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for the complete list of the time zone names.
