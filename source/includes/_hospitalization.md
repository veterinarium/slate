# Hospitalizations

Hospitalization is an abstraction used in Smart Flow Sheet to represent the patient record. As soon as patient is admitted in the hospital the Hospitalization object is created. In turn, the hospitalization object nests patient and client information. This information can be transferred and retrieved from SFS using the patient object and the client object.   

The are the `hospitalizations` and `hospitalization` objects used to create hosptitalizations in SFS and receiving events from the Smart Flow Sheet services.

## The hospitalizations object

### Attributes

Parameter | Type | Description
---------- | ------- | -------
**objectType** | String | *Optional*. Describes the type of the object transferred with the SFS events. Should be assigned `hospitalizations` value
**id** | String | *Optional*. Identificator of the object. Will be transferred to EMR with the SFS events 
**hospitalizations** | Array | The array of [`hospitalization`](#the-hospitalization-object) objects. 


This object will be sent with the `hospitalizations.discharged` event in case when multiple patients were [discharged](#discharge-hospitalization-event) from the Smart Flow Sheet whiteboard.

## Create a patient

> Example Request:

```http
POST /hospitalization HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0

}
```

* Url: /hospitalization
* Method: POST
* Synchronous
* Accepts [`hospitalization`](#the-hospitalization-object) object
* Returns HTTP status 201 in case the new hospitalization has been created
* In case of error returns the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object

The Smart Slow Sheet API does not allow to create several hospitalizations with the same `hospitalizationId`. However, it may happen that the user needs to re-submit the hospitalization that has been previously created (and then deleted or discharged from Smart Flow Sheet user interface). In this case, the second call of this API will return the error with the message `Hospitalization already exists`.  If this happens, we advise to show the user the error message and prompt them if they would like to re-submit the patient. If user selects the option to re-submit the patient, then EMR should:

1. Make a call to [`delete hospitalization`](#delete-hospitalization) API first;
2. Call [create a patient](#create-a-patient) API again to re-submit the patient information.

## Get active hospitalizations

> Example Request:

```http
GET /hospitalizations HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
timezoneName: Europe/Helsinki
```

This method allows to get all hospitalizations that have `active` value of the `status` field.  

* Url: /hospitalizations
* Method: GET
* Synchronous
* Returns HTTP status 200 and a collection of [`hospitalization`](#the-hospitalization-object) objects
* In case of error returns the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object

## Get hospitalization

> Example Request:

```http
GET /hospitalization/emr-hospitalization-id HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
timezoneName: Europe/Helsinki
```

This method allows to get information about hospitalization by id. Specify the `hospitalizationId` of the hospitalization object in the EMR. Use the same `hospitalizationId` that was supplied when hospitalization had been created. 

* Url: /hospitalization/{hospitalizationId}
* Method: GET
* Synchronous
* Returns HTTP status 200 and the [`hospitalization`](#the-hospitalization-object) object
* If hospitalization cannot be found in SFS, the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object will be returned with HTTP 404 status code


## Attach to existing hospitalization

> Example Request:

```http
POST /hospitalization/sfs-hospitalization-guid/attach/emr-hospitalization-id HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
timezoneName: Europe/Helsinki
```

When a patient is created manually by the user with Smart Flow Sheet user interface, the [hospitalization](#the-hospitalization-object) will be sent to EMR with `hospitalizations.created` event. The `hospitalizationId` field of the object will be empty, however, `hospitalizationGuid` field (a unique internal identifier of the hospitalization) will be provided.  You may want to attach your EMR internal ID to this hospitalization to be able to receive any other type of events, as well as download patient reports and use any other API that requires `hospitalizationId`. The HTTP request below provides such possibility. It takes `hospitalizationGuid` value as one part of Url, while your internal `hospializationId` is included in another part of Url.

* Url: /hospitalization/{hospitalizationGuid}/attach/{hospitalizationId}
* Method: POST
* Body: empty
* Synchronous
* Returns HTTP status 200 in case the `hospitalizationId` has been successfully attached to the hospitalization located by `hospitalizationGuid`
* In case of error returns the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object

## Delete hospitalization

> Example Request:

```http
DELETE /hospitalization/emr-hospitalization-id HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
timezoneName: Europe/Helsinki
```

This method deletes hospitalization by id. Specify the `hospitalizationId` of the hospitalization object in the EMR. Use the same `hospitalizationId` that was supplied when hospitalization had been created. 
This method also "unmaps" the `hospitalizationId` from the internal hospitalization record - this allows to submit the patient to Smart Flow Sheet again afterward.

* Url: /hospitalization/{hospitalizationId}
* Method: DELETE
* Synchronous
* If hospitalization cannot be found in SFS, the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object will be returned with HTTP 404 status code

## Discharge hospitalization

> Example Request:

```http
POST /hospitalization/discharge/emr-hospitalization-id HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
timezoneName: Europe/Helsinki
```

This method initiates the patient discharge operation. Specify the `hospitalizationId` of the hospitalization object in the EMR. Use the same `hospitalizationId` that was supplied when hospitalization had been created. This API requires the valid `timezoneName` header specified in the request.

* Url: /hospitalization/discharge/{hospitalizationId}
* Method: POST
* Body: empty
* Asynchronous. In the case of success, the response will include the [hospitalization](#the-hospitalization-object) object with the `status` field equal to `discharged`. At this point, all patient reports are not generated yet - Smart Flow Sheet only initiated the document generation process. After the files are generated, and operation is complete, Smart Flow Sheet will send the `hospitalization.discharged` event to the EMR.
* In case of error returns the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object

<aside class="notice">
To discharge a patient, it should have the patient name and file number fields specified in Smart Flow Sheet user interface. In case, if any of these fields are empty, of if there is a non-finalized anesthetic sheet, then the API will return 400 HTTP code with an appropriate error message that could be shown to the user.
</aside>

## Discharge hospitalization event

> Example of `hospitalizations.discharged` event JSON:

```json
{
    "clinicApiKey": "clinic-api-key",
    "eventType": "hospitalizations.discharged",
    "object": {
	    "objectType": "hospitalizations",
		"id": "sfs-operation-id",
		"hospitalizations": [
			{
				"objectType": "hospitalization",
				"hospitalizationId": "emr-hospitalization-id",
				"hospitalizationGuid": "sfs-hospitalization-guid",
				"dateCreated": "2014-11-05T10:20:19.000+00:00",
				"fileNumber": "#File number",
				"reportPath": "https://pdf-report-webfile-path"
			}
		]
	}
}
```

As soon as one or several patients have been discharged from the Smart Flow Sheet whiteboard, SFS will notify EMR by sending one of the following events:

1. The `hospitalization.discharged` event in case if single patient was discharged. In this case the [hospitalization](#the-hospitalization-object) object will be transferred with the event.

2. The `hospitalizations.discharged` event in case if multiple patients were discharged. In this case the [hospitalizations](#the-hospitalizations-object) object will be transferred with the event.

Every `hospitalization` object transferred with these events will contain the path to the flowsheet report pdf file in the `reportPath` field. If for some reason the value of this field is empty then you may explicitly [download the flowsheet report](#download-the-flowsheet-report).

To enable `hospitalizations.discharged` events please turn on `EXPORT FLOWSHEET AFTER DISCHARGE TO EMR` on the [Settings](#clinic-setup) page.

## Get notified about new hospitalizations

> Example of `hospitalizations.created` event JSON:

```json
{
    "clinicApiKey": "clinic-api-key",
    "eventType": "hospitalizations.created",
    "object": {
	    "objectType": "hospitalizations",
		"id": "sfs-operation-id",
		"hospitalizations": [
			{
				"objectType": "hospitalization",
				"hospitalizationGuid": "sfs-hospitalization-guid",
				"dateCreated": "2014-11-05T10:20:19.000+00:00",
				"weight": 5.8,
				"estimatedDaysOfStay": 1,
				"fileNumber": "# 123",
				"caution": false,
				"color": "#439FE0",
				"doctorName": "Dr. Ivan",
				"medicId": "dr-ivan-emr-id",
				"diseases": [
					"high temperature",
					"vomiting"
				],
				"patient": {
					"objectType": "patient",
					"name": "Jordi Alba",
					"species": "Canin",
					"owner": {
						"objectType": "client",
						"nameLast": "Dow",
						"nameFirst": "Jack",
						"workPhone": "555-55-55"
					},
					"color": "Brown",
					"sex": "M",
					"criticalNotes": "Cefazolin allergy",
					"customField": "some notes"
				}
			}
		]
	}
}
```

When hospitalization is created in Smart Flow Sheet (both through the user interface and [create patient](#create-a-patient) API) the `hospitalizations.created` event will be sent to EMR. The [hospitalization](#the-hospitalization-object) object will be included in the payload. 

The `hospitalizationId` field would be empty in case if the patient were created manually from Smart Flow Sheet user interface. You may want to attach your EMR internal ID to this hospitalization to be able to receive any other type of events, as well as download patient reports and use any other API that requires `hospitalizationId`.

You may find more details about attaching hospitalizations API [here](#attach-to-existing-hospitalization).
