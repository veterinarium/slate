# Events

Smart Flow Sheet will send events to EMR on different occasions:

1. [Inventory import finished](#receiving-the-status-of-import-operation)
2. [When single medical record has been entered or removed](#retreive-single-medical-record)
3. [When mutliple medical records have been entered or removed](#retreive-multiple-medical-records)
4. [When patient has been discharged from the whiteboard](#discharge-hospitalization-event)
5. [When mutliple notes have been entered or removed](#retreive-multiple-notes)

In the future there can be other events added to this, e.g. sending flowsheet report or medical records report on patient discharge, etcâ€¦

Events will be sent only for those hospitalizations that have been created from EMR. Events on hospitalizations created directly from SFS won`t be sent to EMR webhook. 

Sending events require webhook to be registered in SFS. You may register a webhook that will receive all the events associated with your EMR, or you may [register a custom webhook](#register-custom-webhook) for each clinic account. Requirements to webhook:

* HTTP POST method
* Accepts json object of the [`Event`](the-event-object) type
* Returns HTTP code 200 in case of success
* Returns HTTP code 400 in case of error and optionally sends the [`Error`](#the-event-object) object
* Some events (that post 1 item) require synchronous processing
* Some events require asynchronous processing, with further notifications of the results

## The event object

> Example of the event object:

```json
{
    "clinicApiKey": "clinic-api-key",
    "eventType": "treatments.records_entered",
    "object": {
	    
	}
}
```

### Attributes

Parameter | Type | Description
---------- | ------- | -------
**clinicApiKey** | String | Clinic api key to associate clinic on EMR`s side
**eventType** | String | The [`type`](#types-of-events) of the event
**object** | Object | Object of one of the following type: `treatment`, `treatments`, `inventoryitems`, `hospitalization`. This list can expand as soon as new objects will be sent with the API.


## Types of events

Smart Flow Sheet will send several events on different occasions. Below is short description of the events.

Event | Description
---------- | -------
**hospitalization.discharged** | Sent after a patient has been discharged from the Smart Flow Sheet whiteboard
**hospitalizations.discharged** | Sent after multiple patients have been discharged from the Smart Flow Sheet whiteboard
**inventoryitems.imported** | Sent after importing of emr inventory items finished
**medics.imported** | Sent after importing of emr medics finished
**treatment.record_entered** | Sent from SFS when one medical record has been entered/removed
**treatments.records_entered** | Sent from SFS when multiple medical records have been entered/removed

## Register custom webhook

> Example Request:

```http
POST /account/webhook?url=your_custom_url HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: MyClient/1.0.0
Content-Type: application/json
emrApiKey: "emr-api-key-received-from-sfs"
clinicApiKey: "clinic-api-key-taken-from-account-web-page"
```

You may use this API to register a custom webhook that will receive events only for the specified clinic account. You may use this webhook for a group of clinics also. 

* Url: /account/webhook?url=your_custom_url
* Method: POST
* Synchronous
* Url parameters: `url` string. The body of HTTP request should remain empty
* Returns HTTP status 200 in case the new webhook has been registered
* In case of error returns the [`Error`](#the-error-object) object
