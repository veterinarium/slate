# Events

Smart Flow Sheet will send events to EMR on different occasions:

1. [Inventory import finished](#recieving-the-status-of-import-operation)
2. [When single medical record has been entered or removed](#retreive-single-medical-record)
3. [When mutliple medical records have been entered or removed](#retreive-multiple-medical-records)

In the future there can be other events added to this, e.g. sending flowsheet report or medical records report on patient discharge, etcâ€¦

Events will be sent only for those hospitalizations that have been created from EMR. Events on hospitalizations created directly from SFS won`t be sent to EMR webhook. 

Sending events require webhook to be registered in SFS. Requirements to webhook:

* HTTP POST method
* Accepts json object of the [`Event`](the-event-object) type
* Returns HTTP code 200 in case of success
* Returns HTTP code 400 in case of error and optionally sends the [`Error`](#the-event-object) object
* Some events (that post 1 item) require synchronous processing
* Some events require asynchronous processing, with further notifications of the results

## The event object

> Example of the event object:

```json
{
    "clinicApiKey": "clinic-api-key",
    "eventType": "treatments.records_entered",
    "object": {
	    
	}
}
```
